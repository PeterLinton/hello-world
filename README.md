# hello-world
My initial project to run over the basics

"Greetings ma nam is Kalfen, hereyour lunbox hoffa gud te ascool" - Calvin and Hobbes.

Um high, I'm Peter, I'm from Black Mountain (about 20 min east of Asheville), I'm a Christian, an Eagle Scout, and I'm working towords getting a job with Bethesda Softworks.
I like hiking when I can and I like driving, most days I'm driving a '78 Mercedes-Benz 240D, that has a very wimpy engine.
That's about it really.
